that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, (Philippians 2:10, NIV)

Heaven
Earth
Under the Earth 

On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. (I Corinthians 12:22-26)

Heaven - Perfect Parts
Earth - Presentable Parts
Under the Earth - Unpresentable Parts

As opposed to Heaven, Earth, the Sea, Under the Sea
Angels, Saved, Unsaved, Evil

Revelation talks about how there will be no more sea which makes sense in a post apocalyptic world where it is just the righteous who prefer the world and the elect who prefer to be with God. Just like separation of the sheep and the goats is not the same as separation of wheat from the chaff.
